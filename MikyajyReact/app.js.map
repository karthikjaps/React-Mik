Since its inception 20 years ago as a pioneer in Khaleeji color cosmetics and fragrance, Mikyajy has grown into a closely-knit family of xx loyal fans! Mikyajy is the brainchild of Mr. Kamal Osman Jamjoom, who is originally from Saudi Arabia and perfectly understands the cultural nuances and needs of the region. He has spearheaded the KOJ Group for decades and nurtured it to its current success.&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>Mr. Kamal&rsquo;s inspiration behind Mikyajy were the women and the girls in his family. He noticed a gap when he found his female relatives chat about their makeup on several occasions. Sometimes it was about the lack of choice of colors and payoff, other times it was about the staying power, and in general it was about their makeup not being fun. Mr. Kamal set his mind to this idea and merged this gap with Mikyajy. The name Mikyajy means &ldquo;My Makeup&rdquo; in Arabic, which comes from the fact that makeup is a personal experience for every girl. And we at Mikyajy strive every single day to make it as fun, playful, quirky and vibrant as our gorgeous patrons deserve! We truly believe that All Girls Are Beautiful, and we love to empower them to take on the world with confidence!</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>We have an experienced and passionate team of people in Product Research, Product Development &amp; Quality who are there to ensure you&rsquo;re getting the best of color cosmetics (eyes, lips, nails, and face), fragrances, gifting (all-in-one makeup boxes) and exciting seasonal Limited Edition collections.&nbsp; We bring you the best of international trends without forgetting your personal tastes and preferences.&nbsp; So you get exactly what you need, with the quality guaranteed by the state-of-art European manufacturing facilities!</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n        <p>Whether you&rsquo;re a beginner and find makeup a bit intimidating, or you love to experiment and quirk it up with your looks, or you&rsquo;re a pro and know exactly what looks good on you, Mikyajy is your go-to destination!

المنتجات في السوق. ركّز السيد كمال على هذه الفكرة وردم هذه الفجوة بابتكار علامة مكياجي. تعني كلمة \"مكياجي\"&nbsp; باللغة العربية المكياج الخاص بي والذي ينبع من فكرة أن المكياج هو تجربة شخصية لكل فتاة. نسعى كل يوم في مكياجي على جعل المكياج ممتع ومرح وغير مألوف وحيوي بالشكل الذي تستحقه معجباتنا الرائعات! نؤمن بأن كل البنات حلوين، ونرغب في أن يتمكنوا من الظهور للعالم بكل ثقة! </span></p>\n
